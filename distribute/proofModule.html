	<div class="newFeatures--title">New Distilleries!</div>
	<div>Our mission has always been to celebrate and promote the diverse spirits industry within Portland and as the number of distilleries in PDX has grown, so too has the scope and geography of Distillery Row. </div>
	<div style="font-style: italic;">Hence, we are excited to announce that Distillery Row has expanded to the west side!</div>
	<br>
	<div>Aria Dry Portland Gin, Bull Run Distillery, and Freeland Spirits are now official members of Distillery Row. These new members consist of long-time local distillers (several with roots as original founders of Distillery Row) as well as new creators in the field. We are excited to absorb them into the organization and look forward to introducing locals and visitors alike to their amazing craft spirits, cocktails, and events.</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div>But that's not all! The latest addition to the scene is Straightaway Spirits. Located in the heart of SE, Straightaway represents the latest evolution in the craft spirits industry--bottle-ready cocktails! Visit their beautiful new tasting room right off Hawthorne Blvd.</div>
