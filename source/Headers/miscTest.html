			There are more than 92 attractions in a 10-mile radius of downtown. The city offers the No. 1 downtown in America and is
			located minutes from AT&T Stadium and DFW International Airport. As one visitor says, "unpretentious, laid-back, and charismatic
			in all the right ways." For a weekend, a business meeting, sports or family reunion, Fort Worth offers experiences to last
			a lifetime.
